                  </li>

                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Payment of Fees, Costs and Expenses</strong>.

                </p>

                <p>
                  By way of illustration only, if the <strong>Developer</strong> invoices the <strong>Client</strong> via e-mail on Monday, July 2, 2020, then the <strong>Client</strong> must deliver payment to the <strong>Developer</strong> any time before Tuesday, July 10, 2020.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Immediate Invoicing and Payment for Fees</strong>.

              <li>
                <strong>Form of Payment</strong>. The <strong>Developer</strong> shall choose a bank account.

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Consequences of Non-Payment</strong>. Regardless of any provision in this <strong>Agreement</strong> to the contrary, the parties agree that the <strong>Client</strong>’s failure to timely pay any and all invoiced fees, costs, and expenses is a total breach of this <strong>Agreement</strong>, and in that event the <strong>Developer</strong> retains the right to either:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    stop working on the <strong>Development Project</strong> until the <strong>Client</strong> pays all monies owed;
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    immediately terminate the contract. In this event, the termination will be effective as of the date the <strong>Developer</strong> gives the <strong>Client</strong> written notice of termination pursuant to this section; or,
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    continue to work on the <strong>Development Project</strong>. However, in the event the <strong>Developer</strong> continues to work pursuant to this section, the <strong>Developer</strong>’s fees for future work performed on the <strong>Development Project</strong> will increase to <input value="$2000 per day">, and the <strong>Client</strong> agrees to and shall pay this increased daily fee. This fee increase will remain in effect unless and until the <strong>Client</strong> pays all outstanding monies owed, at which time all fees for future services will reduce back to the rate listed in section 3.2.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Client Representative</strong>. Within 24 hours after all parties sign this Agreement, the <strong>Client</strong> shall choose <input value="John Q. Public"> as a <strong>Client Representative</strong>. The <strong>Client</strong> shall give the <strong>Client Representative</strong> agency and mandate to:
            </p>

                give instructions or directions to the <strong>Developer</strong> on behalf of the <strong>Client</strong>, and to review the <strong>Developer’s Work Product</strong> from time to time;
              </li>

              <li>
                amend the details or enlarge the scope of the <strong>Development Project</strong>, as set out in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>; and,
              </li>

              <li>
                consult with the <strong>Developer</strong> on costs and expenses necessary to complete the <strong>Development Project</strong>, and to authorize the purchase of expenses greater than <input value="$100"> in value.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Furthermore, the <strong>Client</strong> warrants that it has given the <strong>Client Representative</strong> the agency and mandate described above, and the <strong>Client</strong> shall not give instructions; amend the details or enlarge the scope of the <strong>Development Project</strong>; or consult on development costs except through the <strong>Client Representative</strong>. The <strong>Client</strong> may replace the <strong>Client Representative</strong> with another at any time, and this replacement becomes effective once the <strong>Developer</strong> has received written notice of the change from the <strong>Client</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Additions to the Development Project</strong>.

            </p>

            <p>
              If the <strong>Client</strong> desires such an amendment, but the <strong>Developer</strong> does not agree, the <strong>Client</strong> may attempt to terminate this <strong>Agreement</strong> by giving the <strong>Developer</strong> written notice of termination pursuant to this section.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the <strong>Developer</strong> does not agree, in writing, to the <strong>Client</strong>’s proposed amendment within <input value="14 days"> after the <strong>Developer</strong> receives written notice pursuant to this section, this <strong>Agreement</strong> is terminated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, no amendment to <strong>Exhibit A</strong> may be made which reduces or eliminates the amount of fees, costs, or expenses already owed to the <strong>Developer</strong> pursuant to this <strong>Agreement</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>

                  <li>
                    all rights to the <strong>Work Product</strong> owned or retained by the <strong>Developer</strong> that do not vest in the <strong>Client</strong> by operation of law; and,
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    all copyright interests (if any) in the <strong>Work Product</strong> owned by the <strong>Developer</strong> under law.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  Nothing in this subsection will be construed to divest the <strong>Developer</strong> of the license granted by the <strong>Client</strong> pursuant to section 6.3.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Developer’s License</strong>. Regardless of any other provision in this <strong>Agreement</strong> to the contrary, and in consideration of the work performed pursuant to this <strong>Agreement</strong>, the <strong>Client</strong> forever grants to the <strong>Developer</strong> a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license to use, copy, or sell all <strong>Work Product</strong> made for hire (or any component thereof) for any purpose and in any manner the <strong>Developer</strong> deems fit, including (but not limited to) the right to copy, modify, make derivative works, publish, sell, transfer, license, assign, or give away the <strong>Work Product</strong>, without giving any notice or payment to the <strong>Client</strong>.
