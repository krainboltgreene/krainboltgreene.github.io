There are a lot of good tech startup ideas that get passed up because of biases, privileges, and bigotry. I want to assist those people who have a hard time being heard in the tech world. For the next six months I'll be available to any person of color, trans, woman, and/or non-neurotypical entrepreneur.  The goal will be to assist in building a prototype over the span of two weeks.

Due to the finite time I'll have to for this project, and what I hope is a sizable response I'm going to do short interviews with the entrepreneur. Anyone who contacts me about this offer will need to be reachable by voice and/or video. We will setup a meeting between us over Skype, Hangouts, or in person to discuss your project. I won't pass judgement on the idea or the direction and instead will focus on the costs and feasibility of building a prototype.

I got the idea for this personal initiative after seeing [a similar effort by Chris Granger][CHRIS]. While his goal was to make money from it, I think the approach is a good guideline. The developer gives a clear guideline for the timeframe, an explicit definition of the tools involved, and what he wants from the deal. Although I don't plan on making money from these projects, I think that's an excellent approach.

People looking to work with me on a project will need to be able to devote time to collaborate. I'll need wireframes, design details, and a list of the core features you want finished. This is to help me figure out what I need to focus on in our limited time together. It will also help me decide if I'm willing to work with on the project. There are only a few projects I would feel uncomfortable doing:

  - Any project designed to exploit people
  - Anything that damages communities or persons

I've been professionally writing code for the last five years. I was a hobby programmer for at least three years prior, but not doing anything of consequence. In my career I've been paid to build web apps for small startups, the [American Express Travel][AMEX] website, and internal APIs for analytics companies. In my free time [I devote a lot of my energy to open source works][REPOSITORIES]. I've got a wide range of experience when it comes to implementing prototypes. I've worked on e-commerce, business-to-business, analytics, and social applications.

I'll be building the prototype in [Rails][RAILS]. I've had significant experience building software in [Ruby][RUBY] and a lot of professional experience building Rails web applications. I'll be putting this code on [Github][GITHUB], hosting it from [Heroku][HEROKU], and deploying from [Codeship][CODESHIP].
