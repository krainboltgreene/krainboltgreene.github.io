      <p>I've been writing software for the last 13 years and professionally working as a software engineer for the last 11 years. I have been a part of a long list of companies and a wide range of teams: I have worked in backend engineering, frontend engineering, analytics engineering, and developer operation engineering roles. I have worked on large web applications and small web applications, as a salaried full-time employee and a contract engineer.I have worked hard to achieve my place in the programming community by working on Open Source software, and mentoring. I devote my free time to the art of programming and my work time to the development of business software.</p>

      <h2 id="whaticando">What I can do</h2>

      <p>I primarily have experience in <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> as a senior full stack engineer having worked on both frontend features, backend features, data processing, and devops. I have extensive experience with <strong>Rails</strong> and a lot of in-depth work experience using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>. I have worked significant with all sorts of JSON-based HTTP APIs including contributing and implementing tooling for JSON:API (the specification and standard). I have a good understanding of <strong>GraphQL</strong> (via Netflix's Falcor, Facebook's Relay, Apollo, and my own implementation). I have a very good working grasp of <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, but I have also used and worked in environments with MySQL and MongoDB.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>GOAT, as a <strong>Senior Backend Engineer</strong> for <em>one year</em>. I worked on making GOAT, all of it's services, significantly more performant for their high-yield commerce periods, worked on bringing their infrastructure and applications up to date with all the latest libraries, toolings, and framework, whipped into shape their developer on-boarding experience,  worked on a “power tool” for their power-sellers that dealt with a high volume of data. I facilitated in the education of my peers in areas they lacked and while also writing documentation for any processes that were stuck in their heads. I first modified and then eventually refactored the shipping logic, saving/making large amounts of money for the company.</li>

I wrote a significant amount of code that is currently running on that platform, including: An advanced matching system, many heavily used API endpoints, an activity monitoring log, ETL tooling, and an advanced coupon/credit/giftcard promotion system. Most of my early work there was in Ruby, but later parts were frontend development in Javascript.</li>

        <li>Dollar Shave Club, as a <strong>Contract Developer</strong> for <em>three months</em>. I worked to help them transition from their Magento platform to a Rails platform. I largely did conversion tasks and teaching materials.</li>

        <li>Nation Builder, as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. My largest contribution was a new permission system that managed who could read, write, and in certain cases "execute" (like send an email) on documents, data, and management tooling. I also built out a prototype system for syncing designer themes into our content management system.</li>

        <li>Makindo, as a <strong>Contact Developer</strong>. I built out an entire platform and infrastructure for crawling Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, and more for information used in telemarketing operations by large car marketing corporations. We built out a data analysis platform and machine learning tool (very primitive) as well as a tool for observing the system.</li>

        <li>iSeatz, as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong>. I was on the foundation team for the new contract they had with American Express to build their new travel website.
