# Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene's Weblog

The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on [Mastodon 🐘](https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene) or you can find me on [Github 🐈](https://github.com/krainboltgreene).
