<h1 id="kurtis-rainbolt-greene">Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing software for the last 12 years and professionally working as a software engineer for the last 10 years. I have worked on large web applications and small web applications, as a salaried full-time employee and a contract engineer.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">my Github at this link</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krainboltgreene">my LinkedIn here at this link</a></p>

<h2 id="what-i-can-do">What I can do</h2>

<p>I primarily have experience in <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> as a senior full stack engineer having worked on both frontend features, backend features, data processing, and devops. I have extensive experience with <strong>Rails</strong> and a lot of indepth work experience using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>. I have a good understanding of <strong>GraphQL</strong> (via Netflix&rsquo;s Falcor, Facebook&rsquo;s Relay, and Apollo). I have a very good working grasp of <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, but I have also used and worked in environments with MySQL and MongoDB.</p>

<h2 id="where-i-want-to-work">Where I want to work</h2>

<p>I currently live in Los Angeles, CA but I am open to moving to the following locations (assuming relocation is paid):</p>

<ul>
<li>Seattle, WA</li>
<li>Portland, OR</li>
<li>Cincinnati, OH</li>
<li>New Orleans, LA</li>
</ul>

<p>I am also <em>extremely</em> open to remote work or freelance work and I have done so previously.</p>

<h2 id="who-i-want-to-work-with">Who I want to work with</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to work for a company that matches my ethical praxis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inclusive &amp; diverse leadership</li>
<li>Non-harmful impact</li>
<li>Open &amp; transparent process</li>
</ul>

<p>I am completely open to discussing what these mean with you.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-have-worked-on">What I have worked on</h2>

<p>I have contributed to a significant number of open source projects of the last 12 years, with these being the ones I think are at least worth mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li>VCR (owner), a ruby network cache that is often used for testing.</li>
<li>unctionjs (owner), a collection of javascript functions with FP in mind.</li>
<li>rubygems (core contributor), mainly the CI but also some other discussions about the web API.</li>
<li>mastodon (core contributor), a federated distributed social network with significant number of users.</li>
<li>redis.rb (core contributor), a set of ruby libraries for talking to redis.</li>
<li>ramda (contributor), a collection of functions for FP in JavaScript.</li>
<li>rails (contributor), a web framework in ruby.</li>
<li>discourse (contributor), a widely used web discussion forum tool.</li>
<li>gitlab (contributor), an open source github.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-i-have-worked">Where I have worked</h2>

<p>These are the companies I have worked for that bear mentioning:</p>

<ul>
<li>GOAT, as a <strong>Senior Backend Engineer</strong> for more than <em>half a year</em>. I helped them become significantly more performant for their high-end periods, cleaned up older parts of their code, whipped into shape their developer onboarding experience, and also worked significantly on a &ldquo;power tool&rdquo; for a certain set of their users that had to deal with high volume.</li>
<li>Laurel &amp; Wolf, as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> for <em>2 years</em>. I wrote a significant amount of code that is currently running on that platform, including: An advanced matching system, many heavily used API endpoints, an activity monitoring log, ETL tooling, and an advanced coupon/credit/giftcard promotion system. Most of my early work there was in Ruby, but later parts were frontend development in Javascript.</li>
<li>Dollar Shave Club, as a <strong>Contract Developer</strong>. I worked to help them transition from their Magento platform to a Rails platform. I largely did conversion tasks and teaching materials.</li>
<li>Nation Builder, as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> for <em>half a year</em>. My largest contribution was a new permission system that managed who could read, write, and in certain cases &ldquo;execute&rdquo; (like send an email) on documents, data, and mangement tooling.</li>
<li>Makindo, as a <strong>Contact Developer</strong> for <em>half a year</em>. I worked primarily on making sure the old platform still worked and giving an in-depth analysis of the previous developer&rsquo;s work. A lot of refactoring and testing.</li>
<li>iSeatz, as a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> for more than <em>half a year</em>. I was on the foundation team for the new contract they had with American Express to build their new travel website. Specifically I worked on the initial application and then further on the Dynamic Packaging team. I also worked heavily with the outsourced component team.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-have-been-a-part-of">What I have been a part of</h2>

<p>I have organized or been a part of organizing these events or groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source NOLA Hackathon (2016), where I participated in a hackathon and won second place. I worked on an anonymous distributed social network (twitter like) that worked via Bluetooth <em>device name</em>. Really fun stuff.</li>
<li>Rails Girls NOLA, a small event of 30+ women getting into software development via fast and loose lessons spanning two days. I was one of the main teachers and mentors.</li>
<li>Hack Dat, a hackathon that I participated in. I built Bard with three other contestants. We didn&rsquo;t win, but we had a good time.</li>
<li>Rails Hotline, a hotline service for people who had Rails-related questions. I received a lot of cool swag for being on the air for the longest time. I think it was around 9 months in total?</li>
<li>NOLA on Rails, a class I started and ran for a year that gave engineers an introduction course on learning Ruby on Rails.</li>
</ul>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
