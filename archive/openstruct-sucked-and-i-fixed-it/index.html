  </header>

  <blockquote>
<p>For reference I wrote this article about a year ago according to the commits at the <code>astruct</code> <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene/astruct">repo</a>. I never submitted it because I got frustrated with the Ruby MRI source contribution process. <code>astruct</code> could definitely use some cleaning up, but actually runs much better in 2.1.0 so the details still stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hello Ruby Core,</p>

<p>In this Pull Request I have made a series of changes that I would like to be added to the Ruby stdlib library <code>ostruct</code>. Before getting into anything I want to stress one thing: <strong>All changes are backwards compatible with the previous ostruct library</strong>. Any non-compatible changes are what I consider bug fixes and assumed behavior corrections.</p>

<p>First a list of problems with the current OpenStruct class:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>OpenStruct</code> is used to create open structured objects and also is often used to give it&rsquo;s open structure behavior to other classes. It is not always desirable or favorable to force the developer to inherit this class.</li>
<li><code>OpenStruct</code> behaves somewhat similarly to a <code>Hash</code>, but lacks a full duck typing and assumed behavior. Importantly to this point <code>OpenStruct</code> can be built from, updated with, and dump to a <code>Hash</code>. It even has a similar public interfaces like <code>Hash#delete()</code>, but defined as <code>OpenStruct#delete_field()</code>, or <code>merge</code> and <code>merge!</code> as <code>OpenStruct#marshal_load()</code>.</li>

<li><p>All of the public and private methods on the <code>OpenStruct</code> are open to easy and annoying overloading. Some of the current methods use other public methods that are <em>likely</em> to be overloaded. A good example of this danger is the current <code>OpenStruct#inspect</code> method, which calls <code>OpenStruct#object_id</code>. It also causes problems like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">example = OpenStruct.new
example.marshal_load = &quot;example;example;example&quot;
  # =&gt; &quot;example;example;example&quot;
example.table
  # =&gt; nil
example
  # =&gt; #&lt;OpenStruct marshal_load=&quot;example;example;example&quot;&gt;
example.marshal_load
  # =&gt; ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)
example.marshal_load &quot;red&quot;
  # =&gt; NoMethodError: undefined method `each_key' for &quot;red&quot;:String
example
  # =&gt; #&lt;OpenStruct:0x3fd970c44120&gt;
example.table
  # =&gt; TypeError: can't convert Symbol into Integer
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Second, in order to address the issues I was having I first built <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/astruct">a gem</a> to solve my problem. All of the below things I&rsquo;ve done have been done in this gem and remain readily available for your use.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>OpenStruct#delete_field</code> method only deletes the table key/value. This is not the expected behavior and ultimately leaves a lot of junk around in the method table.</li>
<li>When using <code>OpenStruct#marshal_load</code> it would correctly create getter and setter methods for each key/value, but it would also delete the entire table. I don&rsquo;t believe this to be expected or intelligent behavior.</li>
<li>One of the tests freezes an <code>OpenStruct</code> object and then redefines <code>OpenStruct#frozen?</code> and it works. Freezing should stop any changes to the object.</li>

<li><p>In order to allow developers to create both <code>OpenStruct</code>-like objects and create regular <code>OpenStruct</code> objects original I have created a module nested in the <code>OpenStruct</code> class called <code>Behavior</code>. That module contains all of the behavior <code>OpenStruct</code> actually receives. Here&rsquo;s an example of what this affords:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Configuration &lt; BasicObject
  include OpenStruct::Behavior
end
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve designed it so that all the public methods are wrapped in double underscores in the same way that <code>Object#__send__</code> and many other important methods are named.</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve aliased &ldquo;underscore&rdquo; methods to the important methods like <code>OpenStruct#__freeze__</code> to <code>OpenStruct#freeze</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>In addition, I have aliased many methods to their &ldquo;underscore&rdquo; forms (ie. <code>OpenStruct#inspect</code> aliased to <code>OpenStruct#__inspect__</code>) to avoid confusion. This works even when someone later overloads those method names.</p></li>

<li><p>Because of the nature of <code>alias_method</code> you can now define a key/value &ldquo;object_id&rdquo; and still have access to the original <code>OpenStruct#object_id</code> with <code>OpenStruct#__object_id__</code>. This avoids the overloading bug explained previously.</p></li>

<li><p>I have added the ability to only dump a specific set of keys with the <code>OpenStruct#__dump__</code> method. This was added to further <code>Hash</code> like behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>I have further improved the tests for this library by either breaking them up into manageable pieces or refined for readability. There are now test for other features of <code>OpenStruct</code> as well as tests for the new features added in this pull request.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to fixing bugs, improving the interface and removing surprising behavior, I used two types of benchmarking: <code>Benchmark#bmbm</code> and <code>Benchmark#ips</code> (<code>benchmark-ips</code> gem), both showing favorable results for my version of ostruct. Here are <a href="https://gist.github.com/3462357">the results</a></p>

    This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects.
    I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more.
    When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here.
