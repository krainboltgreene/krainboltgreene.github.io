      <h1>Mythoas API Framework (Ruby Edition)</h1>
    </header>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re visiting my blog you might already be familiar with my opinion on web API standards and practices. If not I&rsquo;ll give you the quick bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I love [HTTP][HTTP]</li>
<li>If I have a choice the server is going to be behaving according to the [REST][REST] constraints</li>
<li>Furthermore I wildly prefer using the constraints defined for [HATEOS]()</li>
<li>The format of the messages will probably be in JSON</li>
<li>The object bodies will follow the [application/vnd.api+json][JSONAPI] media type</li>
</ul>

<p>That should give you a complete enough picture of me as a API developer and also an idea of how Shogun works.</p>

<p>I created Shogun in an attempt to standardize what I was doing in various other frameworks, like [Rails][RAILS], [Sinatra][SINATRA], [Grape][GRAPE], and even [Crepe][CREPE]. These tools are in their own right very good and any of them could have been a home for me. I found myself more often than not modifying things, adding pieces, and removing settings each project. Any of these changes could theoretically be packaged into a library, but I also found myself not liking the internals of these gems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit straight up I&rsquo;m a snob when it comes to software architecture. For what I do know I have a very strong opinion on. I like to be given objects that I can substitute for whatever the developer thinks I should be using. I like to have access to values, read from <code>ENV</code>, and other things that make changes easy. Libraries are meant to be shared to save time and should be open to the very real possibility of change.</p>

<p>With this in mind I set out to write my own framework. The task seemed daunting at first, but after the first couple of mistakes and hours I realized HTTP frameworks like this are four components:</p>

<ul>
<li>A router middleware(s)</li>
<li>A set of configurations</li>
<li>Some business logic molds</li>
<li>A scaffolding command</li>
</ul>

<p>Shogun&rsquo;s router is incredibly simple because I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of early investment on something I knew would change. It sits as a Rack middleware and is given a anonymous function of routes:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">-&gt;(router) do
  Accounts::Endpoint.new(router: router)
  Sessions::Endpoint.new(router: router)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these <code>Endpoint</code> objects attaches a <code>Route</code> object to the <code>Router</code> object. Here&rsquo;s what a <code>Endpoint</code> looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class Endpoint
  include Shogun::Endpoint

  def initialize(router:)
    member(router: router, verb: &quot;get&quot;, control: Show)
    collection(router: router, verb: &quot;get&quot;, control: List)
    collection(router: router, verb: &quot;post&quot;, control: Create)
    member(router: router, verb: &quot;puts&quot;, control: Update)
    member(router: router, verb: &quot;delete&quot;, control: Destroy)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have a class that inherits some beneficial API from Shogun, and a constructor for matching verbs to controls. I think this part especially highlights the organism oriented design of shogun. The <code>Endpoint</code> object knows how to a specific set of behaviors. It takes a router and starts attaching matcher to that router.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
