      <h1>My (early) thoughts on CSS</h1>
    </header>

    

<p>I know so very little about the world, the universe, and the people around me. With that said I can be confidant in saying that <strong>I know that Cascading Style Sheet syntax is terrible.</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this blog and don&rsquo;t know what Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are then I here&rsquo;s a little introduction:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Developed by</strong>: World Wide Web Consortium<br /></li>
<li><strong>Initially Released</strong>: 17 December 1996, or <em>13 years ago</em>.<br /></li>
<li>CSS is the &ldquo;language&rdquo; used to style HTML pages. HTML Rendering engines (Gecko, Webkit, Trident, Presto&hellip;) render the HTML and then style the output based on the CSS defined in the HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Wrong</strong> Beyond being 13 years old CSS has a whole lot of problems, both major and paper cut, that lead to an unsatisfying experience. It could be a whole lot easier and that alone is something to look into.</p>

<ul>
<li>CSS can be defined 3 different ways. Inline in the <em>style</em> element of a tag, inline in a <em>style</em> tag in the <em>head</em> tag, and via a file referenced in the <em>src</em> element of a <em>link</em> tag inside the <em>head</em> tag. <strong>If this doesn&rsquo;t sound confusing right off the bat then you&rsquo;ve probably been working with CSS a lot.</strong></li>
<li>Inline CSS inside the <em>style</em> element is a glut of characters that becomes, without significantly intelligent syntax highlighting, absolutely unreadable to anyone without a trained eye.</li>
<li>CSS has a mass of characters that aren&rsquo;t needed considering the abilities of modern parsers and syntax highlighters. These characters include: <strong>;  {  } :</strong></li>
<li>The property names are mismatched and unorganized and with the combination variants result in a list of properties that alone surpass 200 lines. <strong>While the combination properties were intended to shorten style sheets they have inadvertently bloated CSS rendering parsers.</strong></li>
<li>CSS syntax is simply far too shortsighted for the uses that we see today. For instance, each property value listing is delimited with a space when there are artifacts that clearly require a space.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-result">The Result</h1>

<p>In the end what you&rsquo;ve got is a styling syntax that is a clutter mess. Sadly, the styling syntax is everywhere and there isn&rsquo;t much you can do about it. Even the best wrapper for CSS, SASS, is limited to Ruby (for now).</p>

<p>I propose that a new CSS be written for HTML Rendering Engines. Something that is far easier to understand, write, and modify.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to call this project <strong>Looking Glass</strong>.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
