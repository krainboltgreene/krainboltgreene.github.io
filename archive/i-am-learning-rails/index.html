      <h1>I am learning Rails</h1>
    </header>

    <p>In the last two weeks I had decided to learn Rails. I&rsquo;ve always had the resources to learn, but I&rsquo;ve always found something else distracting to do. In meeting with other local developers at the Eugene, Oregon Web Developer Meetup (very creative name) I talked with at least three Rails developers with jobs developing in Rails locally. This inspired me to learn.</p>

<p>Yet again I found myself distracted by something shiny and less boring: <a href="http://www.padrinorb.com/">Padrino</a>, a Rails substitute built on my favorite microframework <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. After failing to get it to work (an issue with Bundle I still haven&rsquo;t figured out) I decided to check out the 201mb screencast tutorial. Eleven seconds into the screencast I realized how little I knew about web development and Ruby.</p>

<p>This new insight prompted me to review over my projects and progress. I found that I had been working on learning Ruby for the last 6..7 months and that all of my projects remain unfinished. There are a lot of areas in Ruby that I don&rsquo;t understand or use like metaprogramming. A lot of the unique syntax still escapes me.</p>

<p>This whole thing coupled with the iPad release (and my purchase of one) has made me consider if I even want to do web development. There are so many factors to deal with when developing on the web. I have to know HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the RESTful web interface. All of these parts fit together to make mediocre apps most of the time.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
