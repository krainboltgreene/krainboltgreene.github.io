      <h1>I give up I need to learn functional programming</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Alright. Fine. I finally give in. I <em>need</em> to learn a functional programming language. I&rsquo;ve tried before and given up. First I tried Erlang and it was too complex and strange. Then I tried Haskell and it went from simple to crazy. Then I picked up Clojure and I was like <em>&ldquo;Woah. Verbose!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Learning Ruby has really punched a hole in my mind. Ruby was my first language and has really spoiled me. Every time I pick up a language learning book and the sample Hello World is 5 lines long and 300 characters I can feel the information leak out of my ears. My brain doesn&rsquo;t even want to give it a try.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t afford it anymore though. I need to get a home run or go home. I need to become a professional programmer. No more of this hobby futzing around. Functional programming languages are my only sane solution.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
