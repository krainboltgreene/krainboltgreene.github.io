    <p>There are a lot of good tech startup ideas that get passed up because of biases, privileges, and bigotry. I want to assist those people who have a hard time being heard in the tech world. For the next six months I&rsquo;ll be available to any person of color, trans, woman, and/or non-neurotypical entrepreneur.  The goal will be to assist in building a prototype over the span of two weeks.</p>

<p>Due to the finite time I&rsquo;ll have to for this project, and what I hope is a sizable response I&rsquo;m going to do short interviews with the entrepreneur. Anyone who contacts me about this offer will need to be reachable by voice and/or video. We will setup a meeting between us over Skype, Hangouts, or in person to discuss your project. I won&rsquo;t pass judgement on the idea or the direction and instead will focus on the costs and feasibility of building a prototype.</p>

<p>I got the idea for this personal initiative after seeing <a href="http://iwbyp.chris-granger.com/">a similar effort by Chris Granger</a>. While his goal was to make money from it, I think the approach is a good guideline. The developer gives a clear guideline for the timeframe, an explicit definition of the tools involved, and what he wants from the deal. Although I don&rsquo;t plan on making money from these projects, I think that&rsquo;s an excellent approach.</p>

<p>People looking to work with me on a project will need to be able to devote time to collaborate. I&rsquo;ll need wireframes, design details, and a list of the core features you want finished. This is to help me figure out what I need to focus on in our limited time together. It will also help me decide if I&rsquo;m willing to work with on the project. There are only a few projects I would feel uncomfortable doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any project designed to exploit people</li>
<li>Anything that damages communities or persons</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been professionally writing code for the last five years. I was a hobby programmer for at least three years prior, but not doing anything of consequence. In my career I&rsquo;ve been paid to build web apps for small startups, the <a href="https://travel.americanexpress.com/travel/home">American Express Travel</a> website, and internal APIs for analytics companies. In my free time <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">I devote a lot of my energy to open source works</a>. I&rsquo;ve got a wide range of experience when it comes to implementing prototypes. I&rsquo;ve worked on e-commerce, business-to-business, analytics, and social applications.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be building the prototype in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>. I&rsquo;ve had significant experience building software in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> and a lot of professional experience building Rails web applications. I&rsquo;ll be putting this code on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, hosting it from <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, and deploying from <a href="https://codeship.com/">Codeship</a>.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
