title: "I give up I need to learn functional programming"

Alright. Fine. I finally give in. I *need* to learn a functional programming language. I've tried before and given up. First I tried Erlang and it was too complex and strange. Then I tried Haskell and it went from simple to crazy. Then I picked up Clojure and I was like *"Woah. Verbose!"*

Learning Ruby has really punched a hole in my mind. Ruby was my first language and has really spoiled me. Every time I pick up a language learning book and the sample Hello World is 5 lines long and 300 characters I can feel the information leak out of my ears. My brain doesn't even want to give it a try.

I can't afford it anymore though. I need to get a home run or go home. I need to become a professional programmer. No more of this hobby futzing around. Functional programming languages are my only sane solution.
