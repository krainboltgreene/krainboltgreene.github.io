# Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene

I've been writing software for the last 12 years and professionally working as a software engineer for the last 10 years. I have worked on large web applications and small web applications, as a salaried full-time employee and a contract engineer.

You can find [my Github at this link](https://github.com/krainboltgreene) and [my LinkedIn here at this link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krainboltgreene)


## What I can do

I primarily have experience in **Ruby** and **JavaScript** as a senior full stack engineer having worked on both frontend features, backend features, data processing, and devops. I have extensive experience with **Rails** and a lot of indepth work experience using **React** and **Redux**. I have a good understanding of **GraphQL** (via Netflix's Falcor, Facebook's Relay, and Apollo). I have a very good working grasp of **PostgreSQL**, but I have also used and worked in environments with MySQL and MongoDB.


## Where I want to work

I currently live in Los Angeles, CA but I am open to moving to the following locations (assuming relocation is paid):

  - Seattle, WA
  - Portland, OR
  - Cincinnati, OH
  - New Orleans, LA

I am also *extremely* open to remote work or freelance work and I have done so previously.


## Who I want to work with

I'm looking to work for a company that matches my ethical praxis:

  - Inclusive & diverse leadership
  - Non-harmful impact
  - Open & transparent process

I am completely open to discussing what these mean with you.


## What I have worked on

I have contributed to a significant number of open source projects of the last 12 years, with these being the ones I think are at least worth mentioning:

  - VCR (owner), a ruby network cache that is often used for testing.
  - unctionjs (owner), a collection of javascript functions with FP in mind.
  - rubygems (core contributor), mainly the CI but also some other discussions about the web API.
  - mastodon (core contributor), a federated distributed social network with significant number of users.
  - redis.rb (core contributor), a set of ruby libraries for talking to redis.
  - ramda (contributor), a collection of functions for FP in JavaScript.
  - rails (contributor), a web framework in ruby.
  - discourse (contributor), a widely used web discussion forum tool.
  - gitlab (contributor), an open source github.


## Where I have worked

These are the companies I have worked for that bear mentioning:

  - GOAT, as a **Senior Backend Engineer** for more than *half a year*. I helped them become significantly more performant for their high-end periods, cleaned up older parts of their code, whipped into shape their developer onboarding experience, and also worked significantly on a "power tool" for a certain set of their users that had to deal with high volume.
  - Laurel & Wolf, as a **Senior Software Engineer** for *2 years*. I wrote a significant amount of code that is currently running on that platform, including: An advanced matching system, many heavily used API endpoints, an activity monitoring log, ETL tooling, and an advanced coupon/credit/giftcard promotion system. Most of my early work there was in Ruby, but later parts were frontend development in Javascript.
  - Dollar Shave Club, as a **Contract Developer**. I worked to help them transition from their Magento platform to a Rails platform. I largely did conversion tasks and teaching materials.
  - Nation Builder, as a **Software Engineer** for *half a year*. My largest contribution was a new permission system that managed who could read, write, and in certain cases "execute" (like send an email) on documents, data, and mangement tooling.
  - Makindo, as a **Contact Developer** for *half a year*. I worked primarily on making sure the old platform still worked and giving an in-depth analysis of the previous developer's work. A lot of refactoring and testing.
  - iSeatz, as a **Software Engineer** for more than *half a year*. I was on the foundation team for the new contract they had with American Express to build their new travel website. Specifically I worked on the initial application and then further on the Dynamic Packaging team. I also worked heavily with the outsourced component team.


## What I have been a part of

I have organized or been a part of organizing these events or groups:

  - Open Source NOLA Hackathon (2016), where I participated in a hackathon and won second place. I worked on an anonymous distributed social network (twitter like) that worked via Bluetooth *device name*. Really fun stuff.
  - Rails Girls NOLA, a small event of 30+ women getting into software development via fast and loose lessons spanning two days. I was one of the main teachers and mentors.
  - Hack Dat, a hackathon that I participated in. I built Bard with three other contestants. We didn't win, but we had a good time.
  - Rails Hotline, a hotline service for people who had Rails-related questions. I received a lot of cool swag for being on the air for the longest time. I think it was around 9 months in total?
  - NOLA on Rails, a class I started and ran for a year that gave engineers an introduction course on learning Ruby on Rails.
