# Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene's Resume (SEP 2017)

I've been making programs for the last 11 years and professionally working as a software engineer for the last 10 years. I have largely worked on web applications, but have experience in many fields: ETL, hardware, system operations, and more.


## Who I want to work with

I'm looking to work for a company that matches my ethical praxis which encompasses:

  - Inclusive & diverse leadership
  - Non-harmful software tooling
  - Focused on solving real problems

I am 100% open to discussing what these mean and if they work for your company.


## Where I want to work

I currently live in Los Angeles, CA but I am open to moving to the following locations (assuming relocation is paid):

  - Seattle, WA
  - Portland, OR
  - Cincinnati, OH
  - New Orleans, LA

I am also extremely open to remote work or freelance work and I have done so previously.


## What I can do

I primarily have experience in **Ruby** and **JavaScript**, having worked on both frontend and backend features. I have extensive experience with **Rails** and a lot of recently accrued experience using **React** and **Redux**. I have an intermediate understanding of **GraphQL** (both Netflix's Falcor and Facebook's GraphQL). I have a very good understanding of **PostgreSQL**, with a few holes here and there from learning how to use it myself in extreme circumstances.

## What I have worked on

I have contributed to a significant number of open source projects of the last 10 years, with these being the ones I think are at least important:

  - VCR (owner), a ruby network cache that is often used for testing.
  - unctionjs (owner), a collection of javascript functions with FP in mind.
  - rubygems (core contributor), mainly the CI but also some other discussions about the web API.
  - mastodon (core contributor), a federated distributed social network with significant number of users.
  - redis.rb (core contributor), a set of ruby libraries for talking to redis.
  - ramda (contributor), a collection of functions for FP in JavaScript.
  - rails (contributor), a web framework in ruby.
  - discourse (contributor), a widely used web discussion forum tool.
  - gitlab (contributor), an open source github.


## Where I have worked

I have worked for the following companies:

  - Laurel & Wolf, as a **Senior Software Engineer** for **2 years**. I wrote a significant amount of code that is currently running on that platform, including: An advanced matching system, many heavily used API endpoints, an activity monitoring log, ETL tooling, and an advanced coupon/credit/giftcard promotion system. Most of my early work there was in Ruby, but later parts were frontend development in Javascript.
  - Dollar Shave Club, as a **Contract Developer** for 1 month. I worked to help them transition from their Magento platform to a Rails platform. I largely did conversion tasks and teaching materials.
  - Nation Builder, as a **Software Engineer** for 5 months. I worked on a few minor features, but my largest contribution was a new permission system that managed who could read, write, and in certain cases "execute" (like send an email).
  - Connect For A Cause, as a **Contract Developer** for 3 months. I rewrote the application, added testing and some minor functionality, and on-boarded the future CTO.
  - Makindo, as a **Contact Developer** for 4 months. I worked primarily on making sure the old platform still worked and giving an in-depth analysis of the previous developer's work. A lot of refactoring and testing.
  - iSeatz, as a **Software Engineer** for 7 months. I was on the foundation team for the new contract they had with American Express to build their new travel website. Specifically I worked on the initial application and then further on the Dynamic Packaging team. I also worked heavily with the outsourced component team.
  - DECK Monitoring, as a **Junior Software Engineer** for 6 months. I was pretty terrible at this job, as it was my first salaried and first engineering job. I was basically just a script kiddie given a real job. I over promised and underdelivered a lot.


## What I have been a part of

I have organized or been a part of organizing these events or groups:

  - Open Source NOLA Hackathon (2016), where I participated in a hackathon and won second place. I worked on an anonymous distributed social network (twitter like) that worked via Bluetooth *device name*. Really fun stuff.
  - Rails Girls NOLA, a small event of 30+ women getting into software development via fast and loose lessons spanning two days. I was one of the main teachers and mentors.
  - Hack Dat, a hackathon that I participated in. I built Bard with three other contestants. We didn't win, but we had a good time.
  - Rails Hotline, a hotline service for people who had rails questions. I received a lot of cool swag for being on the air for the longest time. I think it was around 9 months in total?


## What I have made

These are personal projects I've shipped at one point or another:

  - **Kerbal Space Station** which was a mod sharing service for a specific video game (Kerbal).
  - **Bard** which was a half-baked project management tool for a hackathon
