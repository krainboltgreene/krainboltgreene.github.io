      <h1>Hello Eve, I&#39;ve got hobbies!</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Hey Eve!</p>

<p>I want to talk about the kinds of things I did as a kid for fun. This isn&rsquo;t all I&rsquo;ve played or done, but it&rsquo;s a good chunk.</p>

<p>My first video game was on the Apple II. A cell-based 2D shooter Star Wars game. I don&rsquo;t think I ever learned the name. I was about five years old. It was our family&rsquo;s first computer. My father won it from a grocery store lottery. My father had no idea what to make of it and largely ignored it before selling it to pay rent. My next gaming machine was a Nintendo used from the thrift store though I played with my brother in law&rsquo;s Sega, Super Nintendo, and eventually 3DO.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve been playing all assortment of personal computer video games. We were pretty poor during that period so it was either freeware, shareware, or demos. About the age of ten I started to get into RPGs (Roleplaying Games), with my first being a sprite based game called &ldquo;Realmz&rdquo;, and subsequently the &ldquo;Exile Series&rdquo;, also a sprite game. I remember playing Escape Velocity and the Exile series a lot. I like to think it&rsquo;s the environment that helped me understand and appreciate and promote Creative Common work.</p>

<p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/615ml39TfIL._SS500_.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the age of thirteen I was introduced to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition, The Beginner&rsquo;s Set. It was a mini set of the classic and very popular Tabletop Role-playing Game. I tried to find more of these types of games on the computer probably because I associated game play with computers at a very early age. I ran into these things called MUDs (Multi-user Dungeons), the first being Achaea. Delving deeper into the community I found my first MOO (Multi-user Object Oriented MUD) which was a little more focused on the prose instead of gaming. Around that time I also discovered my first gaming shop and received a huge box of really old and expensive Magic: The Gathering cards.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until I was fifteen that I would join my first MUSH (Multi-User Shared Hallucination). The name of the game is pretty much lost, but I do remember that it was based around the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition tabletop game. I had remembered playing it and was heavily intrigued. I would finally get to play this cool RPG with others! My first character there was a cheesy barbarian who used two swords. I was a horrible writer. I only played for a month, but it left a mark and I looked around for others like it in my free time.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t find a Tabletop role-playing game MUD until Awake World, my first experience into a non-D&amp;D TableTop RPG. I didn&rsquo;t have any of the Shadowrun books and knew nothing about the game. I sort of knew what Cyberpunk was from a brief but painful stint on a game called Iconoclast and Cybersphere. Awake Worlds was also a painful experience both in management and relationships. I was fourteen at the time and didn&rsquo;t socialize outside of my computer so I naturally used the game to enhance and feed my inquistive nature and need for peers.</p>

<p>During that period I was responsible for the co-founding of both Awakened Worlds, an off shoot by the original programmer Che, and the foundation and management of Staring At The Sun. Since I had no idea how to programming I depended on a transgendered by the name of Moore. She(He) seemed heavily, and unhealthily, attracted to me. It ended up being a good lesson in dealing with insanity and the insane. Shortly after that I worked to build a third game run by myself and two others (Coin and Hide) called Shadowrun: Las Vegas. It didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon my first MUSH (Multi-User Shared Hallucination) at the age of sixteen called Shadowrun: Denver. It was built and run by Wyldfire and Craig a married pair of guys who are both into the computer world and furry community. I still didn&rsquo;t have any of the books required to play and had to learn by listening and observing. It didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize that I could find books in PDF format on the internet for free illegally. My first illegally downloaded PDFs were the Shadowrun core books (The Core Book, Magic In The Shadows, Man &amp; Machine, Rigger 3, Matrix).</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6f/Shadowrun3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I devoured those books through the screen. At this time I also was gifted with one of my first video games: Warcraft 3. I would play that late into the nights (2am, 3am) with my close friend Jordan Lavigne. We favored defensive positions and had an easier time macro-managing than micro-managing. We both went to middle school together although he was younger and significantly more intelligent.</p>

      <p>The author (that's me) of the weblog is a professional programmer and published writer. This is my personal website where I write things and show off current projects. I'm an avid role-playing game enthusiast with a heavy background in table top games like Dungeons & Dragons, F.A.T.E., and more. When I'm not trying to combine the two things I love I write about them here. Otherwise you can find me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@krainboltgreene">Mastodon üêò</a> or you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/krainboltgreene">Github üêà</a>. I would love to hear from you.
