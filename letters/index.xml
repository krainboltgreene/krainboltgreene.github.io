      <description>Hey Eve!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I sent you any mail, but I think this is a good one. I loved legos as a child and my parents managed to get me quite a few sets. I remember playing with one of my childhood friends and inventing with him a complex role-palying strategy game involving them. In the package you&amp;rsquo;re getting this from are two beginner lego sets. I hope you find them enjoyable, because I enjoyed getting them for you!</description>

      <description>Hey Eve!
I want to talk about the kinds of things I did as a kid for fun. This isn&amp;rsquo;t all I&amp;rsquo;ve played or done, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good chunk.
My first video game was on the Apple II. A cell-based 2D shooter Star Wars game. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever learned the name. I was about five years old. It was our family&amp;rsquo;s first computer. My father won it from a grocery store lottery.</description>
